    The research field of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based systems and has gained significant traction in the last years.
    This paper aims to give an overview over key concepts, contributions and approaches for RAG, focusing specifically on the graph-based G-Retriever model and its similarities with and difference to selected other models.
